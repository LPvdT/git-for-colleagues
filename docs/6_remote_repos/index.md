# Remote Repositories

A lot of people are familiar with services like *GitHub* and *GitLab*, but do not even know Git itself is the driving piece of software behind it. 

Actually, this is not that strange, because the power of Git enables large groups of developers to work on a project concurrently, whilst keeping track of all changes in the grand scheme of things.

This collaboration is achieved using remote repositories.
