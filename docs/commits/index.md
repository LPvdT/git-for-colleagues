# Commits

`Commits` are basically 'save points', wherein Git records the changes within files and folder with respect to the previous state.

* For newly committed files, that previous were not checked, Git simply starts tracking them.
* For files that have been committed previously, and are committed again with changes, Git will keep track of the changes.
