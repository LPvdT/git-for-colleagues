# The Git Repository

A `repository` is a specific folder that you have instructed Git to track.

## Initializing a repository

Before Git is able to track files, you first have to tell it to treat a specific directory as a repository. This is called initialising a respository and is done with the `git init` command.

```bash
# Initialize a repository in your current working directory
git init
```

Basically, from now on out, every change you will make to a file within this working directory will be tracked by Git.
