# Introduction

This is a simple hands-on guide on the basic concepts of *SCM* (Source Code Management) in Git.

The goal here is to introduce you to the concepts and workflows that should suffice for 90% of developers.

In this document, for completeness' sake, I will discuss each concept and show the accompanying CLI commands, along with visualisations for clarity. In a previous session, I have shown how to apply these concepts in a more easy way using the `VSCode` extensions `Git Graph` and `GitLens`.

On a final note, there are a lot of ways to do the same things (faster) in Git, by using commands combined with a load of arguments. The approaches I aim to demonstrate here, are meant to be the easiest to wrap your head around, even if that means there may be a little bit more typing involved.
