# Introduction

This is a simple hands-on tutorial on the basic concepts of Git.

The goal is to introduce you to the concepts and workflows that should suffice for 90% of the developers.

In this document, for completeness' sake, I will discuss each concept and show the CLI commands, along with visualisations for clarity. In the accompanying session, I will show how to apply these concepts in a more easy way using the `VSCode` extensions `Git Graph` and `GitLens`.

On a final note, there are a lot of ways to do the same things (faster) in Git by using commands combined with loads of arguments. The approaches I aim to demonstrate here are meant to be the easiest to wrap your head around, even if that means a little bit more typing involved.
