# Introduction

This is a simple hands-on guide on the basic concepts of *SCM* (Source Code Management) in Git.

The goal is familiarize you with the concepts, workflows and commands that should suffice to comfortably get you going in the vast majority of the projects. If you would want to *manage* complex public repositories, with a lot of bells and whistles involved, you may have to do some additional reading. 

On a final note, there are a sometimes ways to do things similarly in Git, by using commands combined with a load of arguments. The approaches I aim to demonstrate here, are meant to be the easy to wrap your head around, even if that means there may be a little bit more commands to run.
