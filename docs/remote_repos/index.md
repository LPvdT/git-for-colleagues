# Remote Repositories

A lot of people are familiar with services like *GitHub*, *GitLab* or *Azure DevOps Repositories*, but do not know Git itself is the driving piece of software behind it. 

Actually, this is not that strange, because it are these well-known tools enable large communities of developers to work on a project concurrently, whilst keeping track of all changes and releases in the grand scheme of things. Intuitively, the name Git has gained a top-of-mind association with these large tools, instead of the actual piece of software driving the tools.

This collaboration is achieved using public or private remote repositories.
